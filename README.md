# LinkTrim

LinkTrim is a lightweight and efficient URL shortener that converts long URLs into short, easy-to-share links. It is built using Node.js (Express) for the backend and React.js for the frontend. The application provides a seamless way to create and manage shortened URLs with a user-friendly interface.

# Tech Stack & Modules Used

- Backend (Node.js & Express.js)
  
    - Express.js â€“ Web framework for handling HTTP requests

    - CORS â€“ Enables cross-origin requests from the frontend

    - Nanoid â€“ Generates unique, random short URL identifiers

    - Nodemon â€“ Automatically restarts the server during development

- Frontend (React.js)
  
    - React.js â€“ Provides a dynamic and interactive UI

    - Fetch API â€“ Communicates with the backend to generate short links

# How It Works

- User enters a long URL in the frontend.

- The frontend sends the URL to the backend via a POST request.

- The backend generates a unique short ID using nanoid and stores the mapping in an in-memory object.

- A short URL is returned to the user.

- When the short URL is accessed, the backend looks up the original URL and redirects the user.

# Deployment

- Backend: Hosted on Render for reliable API serving.

- Frontend: Deployed on Netlify for fast and easy static hosting.
